# Cursor Governance Rules (SalesHubPro)

## 1. Rule Structure & Maintenance
- All rules must follow the markdown structure outlined below for clarity and consistency.
- Rules must be actionable, specific, and reference actual code or documentation where possible.
- Update rules when new patterns, tools (e.g., MCP server), or workflows are introduced.
- Cross-reference related rules and documentation (e.g., [self_improve.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/self_improve.mdc), [dev_workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc)).

## 2. MCP Server & Cursor Integration
- MCP server must be enabled in Cursor for all AI-driven workflows and Supabase management.
- All contributors must use Cursor with MCP server for project automation, migrations, and edge function deployment.
- Taskmaster tools (task breakdown, complexity analysis) must be run via MCP server in Cursor when possible.
- Refer to the [README.md](mdc:../README.md) and [cursor_project_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor_project_rules.mdc) for integration steps and requirements.

## 3. Rule Content Guidelines
- Start with a high-level overview, then provide specific, actionable requirements.
- Use code examples from the actual codebase.
- Include both DO and DON'T examples for clarity.
- Reference files using `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` syntax.
- Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules where appropriate.

## 4. Rule Improvement & Deprecation
- Continuously monitor code reviews and implementation for new patterns.
- Add new rules for repeated patterns, new tools, or best practices (see [self_improve.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/self_improve.mdc)).
- Mark outdated rules as deprecated and document migration paths.

## 5. Documentation & Cross-Referencing
- All rules must be documented in `.cursor/rules/` and referenced in the README.md as needed.
- Update README.md and rule files together when workflows, integrations, or project structure change.
- For detailed workflow, see [dev_workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc) and [taskmaster.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc).

## 6. Best Practices
- Use bullet points for clarity and concise descriptions.
- Reference actual code and documentation over theoretical examples.
- Ensure all contributors are aware of and follow these rules for consistent, high-quality development.

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules
