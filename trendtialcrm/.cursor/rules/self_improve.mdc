# Continuous Rule Improvement (SalesHubPro)

## 1. Triggers for Rule Updates
- Introduction of new tools (e.g., MCP server, Cursor integration)
- Repeated code patterns or errors in the codebase
- New best practices or technology adoption (see [tech_stack_document.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/tech_stack_document.mdc))
- Feedback from code reviews or implementation logs
- Changes in project structure or workflow (see [README.md](mdc:../README.md))

## 2. Improvement Process
- Compare new code and workflows with existing rules
- Identify gaps, outdated patterns, or missing documentation
- Propose new rules or update existing ones in `.cursor/rules/`
- Reference actual code, documentation, and integration steps (especially for MCP/Taskmaster)
- Cross-link related rules for clarity and DRYness

## 3. Rule Quality & Maintenance
- Rules must be actionable, specific, and easy to follow
- Use real code examples and reference files using `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)`
- Mark deprecated rules and document migration paths
- Update README.md and rule files together when workflows or integrations change

## 4. Documentation & Communication
- Announce major rule changes in project communication channels
- Ensure all contributors are aware of updated rules and best practices
- Regularly review and audit rules for relevance and accuracy
