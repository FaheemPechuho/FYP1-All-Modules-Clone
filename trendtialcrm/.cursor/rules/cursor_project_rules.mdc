# Cursor Project Rules

## 1. Directory Layout
rules/ ← all .mdc governance docs
frontend/ ← React source
backend/ ← Supabase functions & scripts
scripts/ ← one-off automation
docs/ ← exported user docs & diagrams
.env* ← environment definitions
.cursor/ ← Cursor IDE config, MCP server integration, and rules

## 2. Naming
* kebab-case for folders, camelCase for filenames except React components (PascalCase).
* Tests mirror source path and suffix with `.test.tsx?`.

## 3. Commits
* Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.).
* Limit first line to 72 chars.

## 4. Branching
main → staging → production
feature/* → PR → staging
hotfix/* → PR → production

## 5. Code Style
* Prettier + ESLint auto-fix on save.
* No implicit `any`; enable `strictNullChecks`.

## 6. MCP Server & Cursor Integration
* MCP server must be enabled in Cursor for all AI-driven workflows.
* All Supabase project management, migrations, and edge functions should be managed via MCP tools in Cursor.
* Taskmaster integration is required for automated task breakdown, complexity analysis, and workflow management.
* Refer to `.cursor/rules/` for detailed governance and workflow rules.
* See [GitHub repo](mdc:https:/github.com/sheryarkayani/trendtialcrm) for source and CI/CD.

## 7. Documentation
* All new features and workflows must be documented in the appropriate `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`.
* README.md must always reflect the current state of the project, including MCP and Cursor integration.
* Update this file whenever project structure, workflow, or integration changes.
